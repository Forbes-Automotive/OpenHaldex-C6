Version Control:

*** remember and update FW_VERSION in '_defs.h' ***

V1.00.0 - basic code for testing
V1.01.0 - added in reliable mode changing and eeprom saving
V1.02.0 - confirmed Gen1 (OEM & Standalone), Gen4 (Standalone)
V1.03.0 - confirmed Gen2, updated general codebase
V1.04.0 - added feedback for incoming brake/handbrake sensors.  Added options to invert if required
V1.05.0 - brake out GPIO mapped incorrectly - changed
V1.06.0 - added 6040 split
V1.07.0 - added OTA updates (!) Thanks to Sasha!
V1.08.0 - Sorted crash when long press / WiFi reset
V1.09.0 - revised throttle AND speed setpoints to work together with enable/disable lock - thanks to Chris!
V1.10.0 - added custom mode to allow custom lock percentage (based on speed/throttle/body)
V1.11.0 - added SavvyCAN

V2.00.0 - changed to PlatformIO / VS Code
V2.01.0 - added custom UI with:
        > 'on TC, enable 5050' checkbox & 'on ext. button hold, enable 5050' checkbox
        > expert editor with 7x7 array of speed/throttle/lock
V2.02.0 - added ECU speed stale, use ABS, confirmed TC flag (Bremse_1)
V2.03.0 - added speed at Bremse_3 and 'Restore Defaults' clearing onhaldex binary state Expert without refresh.  
V2.04.0 - added Force Mode (rather than fixing lock at 100% when TC active), changed Speed/Throttle/Lock Axis text
V2.05.0 - added Lock Target to Stock - this ensures that a % is achieved when TC/ExtBtn is enabled
V2.06.0 - added Haldex State in binary to better understand the state of the Haldex

V2.10.0 - release
V2.10.1 - fixed the CAN health - always showed Unhealthy because it updading the flag.

** to do **:
        > add throttle/speed axis refresh
        > add 'ota' to match existing layout
        > add reduction in throttle/speed off
        > look into correction_factor (_calculations.cpp) and look to adjust to bring request inline with actual
        > move CAN into interrupt based - ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM
